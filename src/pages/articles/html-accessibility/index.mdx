You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked up like this:

```html
<div>Play video</div>
```
But as you'll see in greater detail later on, it makes sense to use the correct element for the job:

```html
<button>Play video</button>
```

Not only do HTML <code>button</code>s have some suitable styling applied by default (which you will probably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons using the <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Tab</kbd> key and activate their selection using <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Space</kbd>, <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Return</kbd> or <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Enter</kbd>.

Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:

- <b>Easier to develop with</b> — as mentioned above, we get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
- <b>Better on mobile</b> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
- <b>Good for SEO</b> — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <code>div</code>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.
