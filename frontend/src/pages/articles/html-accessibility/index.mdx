You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked up like this:

```html
<div>Play video</div>
```

But as you'll see in greater detail later on, it makes sense to use the correct element for the job:

```html
<button>Play video</button>
```

Not only do HTML <code>button</code>s have some suitable styling applied by default (which you will probably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons using the <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Tab</kbd> key and activate their selection using <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Space</kbd>, <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Return</kbd> or <kbd class="px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500">Enter</kbd>.

Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:

- <b>Easier to develop with</b> — as mentioned above, we get some functionality for
  free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
- <b>Better on mobile</b> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic
  spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
- <b>Good for SEO</b> — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings,
  links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <code>div</code>s, etc., so
  your documents will be more findable by customers.

Let's get on and look at accessible HTML in more detail.

## Good semantics

We've already talked about the importance of proper semantics, and why we should use the right HTML element for the job. This cannot be ignored, as it is one of the main places that accessibility is badly broken if not handled properly.

Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange things with HTML markup. Some abuses of HTML are due to legacy practices that have not been completely forgotten, and some are just plain ignorance. Whatever the case, you should replace such bad code.

Sometimes you are not in the position to get rid of lousy markup — your pages might be generated by some kind of server-side framework over which you don't have full control, or you might have third party content on your page (such as ad banners) over which you have no control.

The goal isn't "all or nothing"; every improvement you can make will help the cause of accessibility.
